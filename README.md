# Automatic-Planner-Scheduler
## Description
A future GUI-based application (with planned design and JAR file) that will function as both a calendar and scheduler. It will automatically allocate time for events you input, helping you manage your schedule more efficiently and stay organized. The application will use custom algorithms—rather than AI—to determine the most efficient and effective schedule. It will dynamically update your schedule based on new inputs or changes, ensuring it stays optimized. More features and enhancements are planned for future updates.
