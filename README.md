# Automatic-Planner-Scheduler
## Description
This is a future Java-based GUI application designed to function as both a calendar and an intelligent scheduler. Its purpose is to automatically allocate time for tasks and events you input, helping you manage your schedule efficiently and stay organized.

The initial version will utilize a custom scheduling algorithm I am developing from scratch in Java. This allows me to gain hands-on experience with algorithm design and time management logic. In future iterations, I plan to integrate AI-driven decision-making to further improve scheduling efficiency and adaptability, giving me practical experience working with artificial intelligence in real-world applications.

The application will dynamically update your schedule in real time when changes or new tasks are added, using custom-built Java algorithms to ensure ongoing optimization based on user inputs.

### Planned Enhancements:
- Integration of AI-based scheduling algorithms to fully optimize time management, adapt to user habits, and make intelligent decisions that enhance overall efficiency and productivity.

- User account management using SQL, enabling multi-user support with securely stored data.

- Personalized analytics and statistics, such as productivity trends, peak usage times, and time allocation summaries, to offer actionable insights for improved time management using SQL.

- Front-end development using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to transition the application toward a web-based or hybrid interface. This will allow for a richer user experience and showcase my commitment to learning full-stack development by combining multiple languages and technologies into one cohesive project.

These features will significantly enhance the application's functionality while highlighting my growing proficiency in Java, SQL, AI, algorithm design, and multi-language development as I continue to explore and integrate diverse technologies into a unified solution.
