# Automatic-Planner-Scheduler
## Description
This is a future GUI-based application designed to function as both a calendar and intelligent scheduler. It will automatically allocate time for events you input, helping you manage your schedule more efficiently and stay organized. Rather than relying on AI, the application will use custom-built algorithms to determine the most effective and optimized scheduling based on your inputs. It will dynamically update your schedule in real time when changes or new tasks are added, ensuring continuous optimization.

Future enhancements include user account management using SQL, allowing support for multiple users with securely stored data. Additionally, the application will generate personalized statistics—such as productivity trends, peak usage times, and time allocation summaries—providing insights to help users improve their time management. These features will not only enhance functionality but also showcase my growing knowledge and practical application of SQL as I continue learning the language.
